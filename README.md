## Repository Description

The files needed to replicate a basic **Unix Shell** and its associated commands can be found in this repository. It is designed to carry out the **0x16. C - Simple Shell** project at and implements many of the same functionalities as the original Ken Thompson's Shell using the POSIX API.

## This shell provides the following features:

* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
* The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
* The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* You have to handle the “end of file” condition (**Ctrl+D**)
